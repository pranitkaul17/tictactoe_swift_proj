# tictactoe_swift_proj
this is a simple tictactoe game developed as a part of learning app developemnt
I have been trying to wrap my head around app development for a better part of 
the past half year, and now i've decided to go in head first and learn by researching and trial and error.
This project marks the start of my journey into app development, it took me 3 different attempts due to some basic errors which i couldnt fix.
